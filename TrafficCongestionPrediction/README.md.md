Traffic Congestion Prediction using Machine Learning

echnical Overview – Real-Time Traffic Congestion Prediction
This project is focused on predicting traffic congestion using machine learning.

What it does:
It uses features like day of the week, time, weather conditions, number of vehicles, and average speed to estimate the level of traffic congestion. The goal is to provide a system that can assist in traffic planning or navigation recommendations.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Python for coding

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for building the machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor)

Dataset:
A sample dataset was used to simulate real-world traffic conditions. The dataset contains the following columns:

day (categorical)

time (categorical)

weather (categorical)

vehicle_count (numeric)

avg_speed (numeric)

congestion_level (target variable)

Project Steps:
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values.

Transformed categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Trained a Random Forest Regressor model.

Evaluated the model using R² Score and RMSE.

The model performed well and gave accurate predictions of congestion levels on unseen data.

Future Improvements:
Integrate with live traffic data APIs (like Google Maps or HERE).

Create a web-based dashboard using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost or neural networks.

Add visualization tools like interactive maps or congestion heatmaps.
