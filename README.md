# Traffic Congestion Prediction Using Machine Learning

This is a mini project I worked on to predict traffic congestion using machine learning.  
It uses features like time, day, weather, number of vehicles, and speed to predict congestion level.

## Files in the Project
- `traffic_model.py` → main Python code with model building and prediction
- `traffic_data_sample.csv` → sample dataset for testing the model
- `README.md` → info about the project

## What I Used
- Python  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib  
- scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor)

## Model Accuracy
I trained the model using Random Forest and tested it on sample data.  
R² Score came out to be pretty good (~0.85), and it gives decent predictions.

## How to Run It
- Make sure Python is installed
- Run `traffic_model.py` in any IDE (VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, etc.)
- You can also try it on your own dataset later

## What's Next
I plan to add live traffic data from an API and maybe build a simple interface using Streamlit.
