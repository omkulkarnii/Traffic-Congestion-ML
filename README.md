#Real-Time Traffic Congestion Prediction using ML

**This project predicts traffic congestion levels using machine learning based on factors like time, day, weather, vehicle count, and speed.**

## Files
- `traffic_model.py` → ML model using RandomForestRegressor  
- `traffic_data_sample.csv` → Sample traffic data  
- `README.md` → Project info

## Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest, train-test split, R² score)

## Results
- R² Score: ~0.85  
- Model trained on sample data, ready for real-time API integration

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo  
2. Run `traffic_model.py` in any Python environment  
3. Modify to add real-time data later

## Future Ideas
- Use live traffic APIs (Google Maps, HERE, TomTom)  
- Add a simple Streamlit web app
